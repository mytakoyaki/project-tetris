# Point and Exchange System Implementation Log

**Date**: 2025-06-25 23:15  
**Session**: ClaudeTetris React Development - Point System Integration  
**Previous**: T-Spin and SRS system completion  

## Overview
Implemented the complete point and exchange system from ClaudeTetris specifications, including point earning mechanics, cumulative exchange costs, and integration with fever mode free exchanges.

## Completed Features

### 1. Point System Type Definitions (`src/types/points.ts`)
- **PointSystem Interface**: Tracks total points, earned points, exchanges, and next exchange cost
- **PointTransaction Interface**: Records all point earning/spending activities
- **ExchangeAction Interface**: Logs piece exchange history
- **Point Values Constants**:
  - Piece placement: 10 points
  - Soft drop: 0.5 points per line
  - Hard drop: 1 point per line
  - Exchange costs: [45P, 65P, 90P, 120P, 160P] (cumulative)

### 2. Redux State Integration (`src/store/slices/gameSlice.ts`)
- **Extended GameState**: Added pointSystem, pointTransactions, exchangeActions
- **Point Earning Logic**:
  - Piece placement: 10P per piece
  - Line clearing bonuses
  - Soft/hard drop calculations
  - Spin bonus integration
- **Exchange System Logic**:
  - Cumulative cost progression (45Pâ†’65Pâ†’90Pâ†’120Pâ†’160P)
  - Free exchanges during fever mode
  - Maximum 5 exchanges per game
  - Complete transaction logging

### 3. Point Display Component (`src/features/game/components/PointDisplay.tsx`)
- **Real-time Point Tracking**: Shows total points and earned points
- **Exchange Status**: Next cost, used exchanges (X/5)
- **Fever Mode Integration**: Shows "FREE" during fever mode
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status chips (ready/locked)
- **Responsive Design**: Matches ClaudeTetris visual style

### 4. Exchange Controls Component (`src/features/game/components/ExchangeControls.tsx`)
- **7-Piece Selection**: All tetromino types (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- **Visual Piece Shapes**: ASCII art representations
- **Color-Coded Pieces**: Matches standard tetris colors
- **Smart Validation**: 
  - Disabled when insufficient points
  - Disabled when current piece matches selection
  - Shows cost vs "FREE" during fever mode
- **Cost Display**: Shows point requirements and remaining exchanges

### 5. Updated Sidebar Integration (`src/features/game/components/Sidebar.tsx`)
- **Left Sidebar**: Hold slots, level, fever mode status, spin statistics
- **Right Sidebar**: Score, point system, exchange controls, next pieces
- **Fever Mode Display**: Shows active/inactive status and countdown
- **Consistent Styling**: Maintains ClaudeTetris visual theme

## Technical Implementation Details

### Point Earning System
```typescript
// Basic placement points
state.pointSystem.totalPoints += POINT_VALUES.PIECE_PLACEMENT (10P)

// Soft drop points (per line moved down)
const softDropPoints = action.payload.dy * POINT_VALUES.SOFT_DROP_PER_LINE (0.5P)

// Hard drop points (total distance dropped)
const hardDropPoints = dropDistance * POINT_VALUES.HARD_DROP_PER_LINE (1P)

// Line clear bonus
const linePoints = completedLines.length * POINT_VALUES.LINE_CLEAR.SINGLE (100P)
```

### Exchange Cost Progression
```typescript
// Cumulative exchange costs
EXCHANGE_COSTS: [45, 65, 90, 120, 160]

// Cost updates after each exchange
state.pointSystem.exchangesThisGame++
state.pointSystem.nextExchangeCost = POINT_VALUES.EXCHANGE_COSTS[state.pointSystem.exchangesThisGame]
```

### Transaction Logging
```typescript
// All point activities are logged
state.pointTransactions.push({
  type: 'earn' | 'spend',
  amount: number,
  source: 'placement' | 'soft_drop' | 'hard_drop' | 'exchange' | 'line_clear' | 'spin_bonus',
  description: string,
  timestamp: Date.now()
})
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Fever Mode Integration
- **Free Exchanges**: All exchanges cost 0P during fever mode
- **Visual Indicators**: Exchange controls show "FREE" instead of cost
- **Status Display**: Fever mode countdown in sidebar
- **Automatic Activation**: Every 20 blocks placed

### Spin System Integration
- **Bonus Points**: T-Spin, SZ-Spin, I-Spin, JL-Spin bonuses add to point total
- **Transaction Logging**: Spin bonuses recorded in point history
- **Display Integration**: Last spin shown in sidebar statistics

## Testing Status
- **Development Server**: Successfully starts and loads
- **Component Integration**: All components properly imported and exported
- **State Management**: Redux state properly extended and functioning
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches ClaudeTetris design language

## Next Steps (High Priority)
1. **Fever Mode System**: Implement particle effects and 4x score multiplier
2. **Hold System**: Implement dual hold slots with 15P cost each
3. **Achievement System**: Implement 15 achievements with point rewards
4. **Ranking System**: Implement 14-rank progression system

## Files Modified/Created
```
src/types/points.ts (NEW)
src/features/game/components/PointDisplay.tsx (NEW)
src/features/game/components/ExchangeControls.tsx (NEW)
src/store/slices/gameSlice.ts (MODIFIED - Added point system logic)
src/features/game/components/Sidebar.tsx (MODIFIED - Integrated new components)
```

## Known Issues
- None currently identified
- All TypeScript compilation successful
- All components properly integrated
